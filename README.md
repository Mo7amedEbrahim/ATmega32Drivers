# Features
The ATmega32 Drivers repository offers the following features:

## GPIO Driver:
Provides functions to configure and control the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins of the ATmega32 microcontroller.

## UART Driver:
Offers functions for serial communication using the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) module of the ATmega32.

## ADC Driver:
Enables analog-to-digital conversion using the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) module of the ATmega32, allowing precise measurement of analog signals.

## Timer Driver:
Provides functions to configure and utilize the Timer/Counter modules (Timer0, Timer1, Timer2) of the ATmega32 for various timing and counting operations.

## PWM Driver:
Offers functions to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals using the Timer/Counter modules of the ATmega32, useful for controlling motor speed, LED brightness, and other applications.

## External Interrupt Driver:
Enables the utilization of external interrupts on specific pins of the ATmega32, allowing the microcontroller to respond to external events.

## SPI Driver:
